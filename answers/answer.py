INTRODUCTION

The goal of this assignment is to implement a basic analysis of textual 
data using Apache Spark (http://spark.apache.org) and 
Dask (https://dask.org). 
'''

'''
DATASET

We will study a dataset provided by the city of Montreal that contains 
the list of trees treated against the emerald ash borer 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_ash_borer). The dataset is 
described at 
http://donnees.ville.montreal.qc.ca/dataset/frenes-publics-proteges-injection-agrile-du-frene 
(use Google translate to translate from French to English). 

We will use the 2015 and 2016 data sets available in directory `data`.
'''

'''
HELPER FUNCTIONS

These functions are here to help you. Instructions will tell you when
you should use them. Don't modify them!

#Initialize a spark session.

        .appName("Python Spark SQL basic example") \
        .config("spark.some.config.option", "some-value") \
        .getOrCreate()
    return spark

'''
Plain PYTHON implementation

To get started smoothly and become familiar with the assignment's 
technical context (Git, GitHub, pytest, Travis), we will implement a 
few steps in plain Python.
'''

#Python answer functions
def count(filename):
    '''
    Write a Python (not DataFrame, nor RDD) script that prints the number of trees (non-header lines) in
    the data file passed as first argument.

SPARK RDD IMPLEMENTATION

You will now have to re-implement all the functions above using Apache 
Spark's Resilient Distributed Datasets API (RDD, see documentation at 
https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html). 
Outputs must be identical to the ones obtained above in plain Python. 
However, all operations must be re-implemented using the RDD API, you 
are not allowed to simply convert results obtained with plain Python to 
RDDs (this will be checked). Note that the function *toCSVLine* in the 
HELPER section at the top of this file converts RDDs into CSV strings.

DataFrame API (see documentation at

you are not allowed to simply convert results obtained with the RDD API 
to Data Frames. Note that the function *toCSVLine* in the HELPER 
section at the top of this file also converts DataFrames into CSV 
strings.
